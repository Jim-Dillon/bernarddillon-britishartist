            <p>In 1967, at the age of twenty-six, Bernard won the first prize in a National painting competition sponsored by Walls Ice Cream Ltd., and Ocean Spray Inc. His prize was a holiday for two in Sardinia.</p> 

            <p>More recently, The British Mycological Society, at the request of Dr. Henry Tribe, also used one of Bernard’s forest landscapes as a back drop in their U.K. Travelling Exhibition.</p>

            <p>Since his retirement Bernard has returned to painting uncommissioned work for his own pleasure and is now a member of the City of St. Albans Art Society. Recently, he was accepted as an official friend to the Royal Society of British Artists. He has exhibited in the following;- The Mall Galleries, home to The Federation of British Artists and located only yards from The National Gallery in London:- The Orange Dot Gallery, Tavistock Place, W.C.1. and the 2012 Annual Exhibition of The Royal Society of Miniature Artists, Sculptors and Gravers. In addition to the above, three of his paintings were selected by an independent judging panel to be exhibited in the 2012 Annual Art Exhibition held in the Municipal Art Gallery and Museum of Luton. This particular prestigious exhibition has an exceedingly wide catchment area and is open to all artists residing in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire.</p>

            <p>In the following year, 2013, Dillon was once again successful and had two further works accepted. One of which, the forty-two inch high painting entitled “Luton’s Personal Sacrifice (near or far)” was chosen by the adjudicators as a winning submission. It was subsequently awarded the Annual “Inspired by Luton Prize”, sponsored by the Murry Barford Trust and included a financial sum of an undisclosed amount.</p>

            <p>A recent portrait, in oils, of the 10th Bishop of St.Albans, The Right Rev’ Dr. Alan Smith, was first shown to the public at the Summer Exhibition of the City of St. Albans Art Society where the judges awarded the painting the status of ‘Highly Commended’. Since then, the Bishop has acquired the painting and is now its owner. It currently hangs in the cathedral premises alongside paintings of earlier Bishops.</p>

            <p>On completion of the Bishop’s portrait Dillon found for a few months that he was able to concentrate on outstanding projects. However, it was not long before his desire to return to portraiture occurred. On that occasion, the subject of the painting was to be Kelvin  Hopkins, Member of Parliament. Dillon worked on it for a number of weeks and when Mr. Hopkins finally saw the finished portrait he is reported to have been pleased with the result. It is now owned by the Hopkins family and is in their safe keeping. A photograph of the portrait and its presentation can be seen in ‘The Gallery’ that follows.</p>

            <p>It should also be noted that both his sons, STEVE DILLON and GLYN DILLON are professional artists and further details about them can easily be obtained from the Internet. In addition, his grandson, MARK DILLON, B.A. has already obtained a First Class Honours Degree in Art and has completed further art education at Slade, London, and has now been awarded his Masters Degree, M.F.A.</p>
